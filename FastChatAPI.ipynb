The Shiba Inu breed had already gained popularity in online culture through the \"doge\" meme since 2010. Dyszewski created custom \"Fellas\" for those who donated to the Georgian Legion. NAFO (NATO and Friends) was established on May 24, 2022, with a significant presence of current and retired service members from Ukrainian and NATO militaries, as well as Eastern Europeans and the Eastern European diaspora. The group, estimated to have \"tens of thousands\" of associates as of September 2022, incorporates the \"Fellas\" in edited images, TikTok-style videos of Ukrainian troops with dance music, and war footage to mock Russia's military and praise Ukraine's soldiers. NAFO uses the term \"vatniks\" to refer to their opponents both online and on the battlefield. Some NAFO members specifically focus on countering the \"whataboutism\" defense of the Russian invasion.\"\"\"\n",
